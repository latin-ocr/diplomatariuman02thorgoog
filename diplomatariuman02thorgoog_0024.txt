Sir H. Nicolas (Claram of Hist p. 363) ιοιιιοιῙιιι “ lappenberg's idea that
the Saxon kings dated hom their coronation and unctiori, appears un-
tenabla on grounds drawn from the old Tentoria law; and a remarkable
factin contradiction of that theory is firmished by ngar, who was not
crowned until a great many years after his accession, and who dated from
his accession, and afterwards need the double date of his accession and
coronation'’ Now Ido not see that Lappenberg here expresses any idea
or opinion on the subject; and the charters referred to are both marked
by Kembls, and, I doubt not, very justly‚ as spurious (cod Dipl. N os 614,
584, and this vol. p. 211). Other instanees are not wanting of s charter
marked as forged being cited as an authority.
