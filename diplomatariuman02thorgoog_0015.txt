PREFAOF„ xiii

Ι am, indeed, led to bc diffident as to the authen·
ticity 01 some documenta by a comparison with others
01 the period, whereby their character appears at most
questionable. But even those generally regarded as
decided largeries may not always be lalse with respect
to their substance, being probably fabricatione by the

may not here seem altogether out 01 place. The documenta alluded to
are those exhibiting the subscriptione 01 AElfgifu and AEthelgilu as the
wile and mother-in-law 01 king Eadwig. (See p. 191.) 'l'wo Roman
Catholic writers (Milner, in hie History 01 winchester, and Linges-d,
in his History 01 England, and his Hiet and Antiq. 01 the A. S. Charch)
do not hesitate to pronounee AElfg'fu to have been the lsing'e mistrees;
while others not 01 the Romish Ohurch regard her as his lawlul
wile. I was among the latter; but doubts have, Ι regnet to say, 01
late ariaco in my mindae to the genuineness 01 these subscriptione.
In the first place, among the numerous char-tere 01 Eadwig‚ thereie
not another in which either 01 these names appears Secondly‚ it ie
only in the Abingdon Chronicle or chartulary they are found, the
original dead or deeds, isaach ever existed, being no longer extant.
Now we lrncw that Eadwig was a most munificent benefactor to this
ahbey. 1 use the words 01 a much-lamented friend: “The donatione
to Abingdcn in the time 01 Eadwig were splendid and numerous.
His own immediate ganta to our Lady 01 Abingdon, to St. Benet,
the patron 01 monle, and to the abbot AEthelwold, amounted to fifty
hides, aad those made by his sonante, with hie consent and approbation,
excesded three hundred and forty. In the very last year 01 his reign he
conferred on Abingdon a Oharter (see p. lea) in the amplest form, eon·

capable 01 perpetrating such a forgery, the daed, though reprehensible,

to one MS. 01 the Saxon Chronicle, we are told that, an. 958, archbishop
