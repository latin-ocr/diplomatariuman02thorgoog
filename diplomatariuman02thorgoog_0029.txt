the charters ol the firstmentioned class I also offered
to the Master of the Rolls, hut this offer iared no better
than tha preceding one. This is the volume which Ι

of tho Rolls for the loan oi a collection ol transcripta of
Angla-Saron charters, which tha late Mr. Petrie had
caused to he made, and which had long been lying
useless at the Rolls House. My nequest was obligingly
met with immediate compliance, ior which Ι herc offer
my very sincere thanks. When Ι made this nequest, Sir
Francis Palgrave was Deputy Keeper oi the Records.
'lhese transcripta, though known to, were never seen by
Mr. Kembla. They consist oi about 350 chortem, oi
which many are irom the Stowe collection, many irom
westminster, and some from the collection oi Sir Thomas
Phillipps ¹at Middlehill. Such as fell within my pro·

documenta not included in the Codex Diplomaticus Ι
have copies; the others I collated with that work 3 and
I now possess transcripte oi 73 unprinted charters, which
may one day serve as a' supplement to Mr. Kemble's

which had nearly proved fatal, irom which I still suffer,
and by which the progressos the work was long re·
