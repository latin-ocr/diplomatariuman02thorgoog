PREFAOE. xxi

There are two principal kinds of indictions; the one
known as the Caesareas or Imperial Indiction‚ which, at
least till the eighth century, was generally used in Eng-
land and Fhance, and began on the esth of September3
the other, the Pontifici, or Roman, which commenced on
the toth of December or ist of danuary, according to
which of those days was taken for the beginning of the
year—thus obviating any confusion or difficulty that

rule for finding tha year of the Indiction: Hoc autem argumento quota
