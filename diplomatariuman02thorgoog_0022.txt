PREFACE.

to the introduction of Christianity in the year 597 we
know nothing; but as all the documents with which wc
are here concerned are posterior to that erent, the date, ·
as may naturally be supposed, is computed from the
year of the Incamation, commencing on the aoth of De-
cember, or the lst of J anuary; for that, together with thc
Christian religion, Augustino introduced the Christian
era, seems almost a matter of course 3 although there
may not be found any undeniable instance of its use
among us anterior to the year 676, under which date
there is a charter of Osric, sub-king of the Hwiccas
(Ood. Dip. No. XII.), the genuineness of which there
appears no reason to question.

Besides the year of the lucamation, the date ofa
charter is, in most cases, further determinad by the
number of the Indiction, consisting of a oenstautly re·
nursing aycle of fifteen years. The Indiction, accord-

ing to the best authorities, came into common use in
312, dming the reign of Constantine, and, as the name
implica, was the edict, or indictio, subscribed hythe
emperor, and fired up in the prinoipal city of each dio·
cese during two months previous to the first day of Sep·
tember‚ and has reference to the firing of the tributas.
Of the origin of the Indictions nothing is known¹.
