xxiv PRanou

cipum meorum consensu ”3 while others of an inferior
class probably issued from the Scir-gembt, or County
court; though those of granta by archbishops andbishops
are usually drawn up aud signcd hy the members ol the
cathedral chapter.

From the original charters still extant, it appears that
the names ol the witnesscs are in the same handwriting
as the body ol the charter; and even the crossen pre·
fixcd to the several signatores are most frequently in
the same hand; thus apparently leaving to the attestin'g
party (pro ignorantia litterarum) the sole office of touch·
ing the crosa, and orally declaring the signatura to bc
his own act and deed, as at the present day; though it
appears probable that the cross was sometimes marked
by the witness himself, as we find the expression (in a
charter marked as spurious, it is true) “ signum crucis
aravi” ¹, equivalent to the Old Norae, at rista mna, to
yrave runca. The aynorcatic litterarum is, uo doubt,
chiefly applicablc to the lay witnesses, as we cannot but
suppose that most of the ecclesiastical dignitaries were st
least capable ol siguing their names.

Scala, in the modern acceptation of the word, do not
appear to have been used by the Anglo·Sarons in sign·
ing charterss-the term capillum, which occurs iu some
iustrumenta ola late date, being merely the diminutive
of sa'paam3 so· that cum capillo sanotae crucis is identical
with cum myro sancta crucis. Other synonyma are
tauma, agalma, indicium, trophaeum, etc. etc.2

¹ Ood. Dipl. i. p. 218.

² That scala for other purposes were in risa appears from the following :-
A scal of Ethelwald (830-870) was dug up in a gardan, about two
hundred yards from the gata of tha monastery at Eye iu Sullollr, by a
lahomor, who gare it to the child of aworlrman employed on the farm.
The child threw the saal into the tire, and it thus received some injury.
